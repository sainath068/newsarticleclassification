**üì∞ News Article Classification Project**

**Introduction**

This project aims to classify news articles into different categories using state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) for classification, T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) for text summarization, and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) for topic modeling.

**üöÄ Features**

**BART Classification:** Utilizing BART for accurate classification of news articles into various categories.
**T5 Text Summarization:** Leveraging T5 to generate concise summaries of news articles.
**LDA Topic Modeling:** Employing LDA for extracting topics from news articles.


**üîë Key Components**
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the news article data for further analysis.

**BART Model:** Training and fine-tuning the BART model for news article classification.

**T5 Model:** Implementing T5 for generating summaries of news articles.

**LDA Model:** Applying LDA to discover underlying topics within the news articles.

**üõ†Ô∏è How to Use**

Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your_username/news-article-classification.git

2.Install the required dependencies.

pip install -r requirements.txt

**üìä Results**

BART achieves an accuracy of X% on the test dataset for news article classification.

T5 generates informative summaries with an average ROUGE score of X.

LDA identifies X distinct topics within the news articles.

**üîÆ Future Work**

Experiment with different pre-trained models for classification and summarization.

Enhance the data preprocessing pipeline for better text cleaning and feature extraction.

Incorporate additional evaluation metrics for model performance assessment.
